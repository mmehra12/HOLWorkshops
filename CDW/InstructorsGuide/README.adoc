== Overview

This guide provides instructions for setting up, validating, and destroying the environment for our workshop. Use the navigation links below to quickly jump to each section.

== INIT

[.underline]
* Environment and Keycloak Creation

For environment and Keycloak creation, use the following automation:

link:https://github.com/pjoshi06/cdp-public-cloud-provisioner/blob/main/README.adoc[GitHub Repository]

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have all necessary permissions and configurations before proceeding with the automation scripts.
====

[.underline]
* Data Upload

Once the environment and the Keycloak servers are created, upload the data to the object store. This data will be used to create tables during the workshop.

The data can be found in this repo under the "data" directory

Upload this data to S3 if working on AWS.

Example:

Bucket Name : workshopcdpenvbucket

Create a folder called "cdwworkshop" and upload the folder in the "data" directory to that s3 folder.

The final directory structure on S3 should look like

s3://workshopcdpenvbucket/cdwworkshop/airlines-raw/airlines-csv

[.underline]
* Grant permission to user group

Goto <YOUR ENVIRONMENT> -> ACTIONS -> MANAGE ACCESS -> IDBroker Mapping

Click on "+" at the bottom right to add a new row.

Under username or Group add the group name of the user group that the automation creates. <ENVIRONMENT NAME>-aw-env-user-group

Under "Role" copy past the Data Access role from above click on "Save and Sync"
